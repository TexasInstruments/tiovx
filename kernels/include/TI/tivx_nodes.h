 *             0: Uninitialized border. The border pixels are left uninitialized. The pixels have the values that were there initially
 *                before the processing.

 * \param [in] graph Reference to vx_graph.
 * \param [in] kernel Reference to vx_kernel.
 * \param [in,out] appParams is an array of 5 parameters:
 *             - config vx_user_data_object type corresponding to the configuration (named string: sTIDL_IOBufDesc_t)
 *             - network vx_user_data_object type corresponding to the network (named string: TIDL_network)
 *             - createParams: vx_user_data_object type corresponding to the structure TIDL_CreateParams.
 *                             This structure contains create-time parameters and are used only one time to initialize
 *                             the node.
 *                             Currently members quantHistoryParam1, quantHistoryParam2, quantMargin need to be initialized by
 *                             the application.
 *             - inArgs: vx_user_data_object type corresponding to the structure TIDL_InArgs. Used to pass input parameters
 *                       that goes in effect during the node's process call when graph is executed. These parameters
 *                       can be updated before each frame execution of a graph. Currently the list of parameters is empty.
 *                       So inArgs is just a placeholder for future extension.
 *             - outArgs: vx_user_data_object type corresponding to the structure TIDL_outArgs. Used to collect output parameters
 *                       that are returned by the node's process call when graph is executed. These parameters
 *                       are refreshed after each frame execution of a graph. Currently the list of parameters is empty.
 *                       So outArgs is just a placeholder for future extension.
 * \param [in] input_tensors Array of input tensors
 *             This parameter is ignored when the first layer of the network is a data layer, which is most of the time.
 *             Only networks that are dependent on the output of a previous networks have first layer that are not data layer.
