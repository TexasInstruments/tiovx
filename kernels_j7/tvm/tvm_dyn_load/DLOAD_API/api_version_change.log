 Dynamic Loader API and Loader Core - Version Number Change Log
 ==============================================================

 Version Number Description
 --------------------------

 The version number associated with the Dynamic Loader API and the Loader Core
 sources has three components:

 <major version>.<minor version>.<patch version>

 major version - is incremented if there is a change to the API that creates a
                 compatibility discontinuity.

 minor version - is incremented if functionality is added to the API without 
                 causing a compatibility discontinuity.

 patch version - is incremented if a defect has been repaired, a performance
                 enhancement has been added, or the source code has been 
		 refactored in some way. There should not be a compatibility
		 discontinuity created by an increment to the patch version.
