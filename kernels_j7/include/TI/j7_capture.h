/*! \brief [Graph] Creates a camera capture node.
 * \details The capture node takes in a user data object of type <tt>\ref tivx_capture_params_t</tt> to
            configure one or more capture channels. The output is of type \ref vx_object_array, which contain an array of
            either \ref vx_image or \ref tivx_raw_image data types.  \ref vx_image is used if the sensor outputs processed
            image formats, while \ref tivx_raw_image is used for raw sensor outputs.

            The number of items in the output object array corresponds to the number of syncronized, homogeneous
            camera sensors assigned to the capture node.  Each item in an object array must have the same
            dimensions and formats.  If multiple sensors are needed tot be configured at different rates, formats, or
            resolutions,  then separate capture nodes should be used and syncronized by the application code.

            \note The capture node does not program or control the sensors, but relies on the application (or custom nodes)
            to call into the sensor drivers.
 * \param [in] graph The reference to the graph.
 * \param [in] input The input user data object of a single capture params structure of type <tt>\ref tivx_capture_params_t</tt>.
 * \param [out] output Object array output which has been created from an exemplar of either \ref vx_image or \ref tivx_raw_image.
 *              If using \ref vx_image, the image type MUST be one of the following formats:
                <tt>\ref VX_DF_IMAGE_RGBX</tt>, <tt>\ref VX_DF_IMAGE_U16</tt>,
                <tt>\ref VX_DF_IMAGE_UYVY</tt>, <tt>\ref VX_DF_IMAGE_YUYV</tt>.
