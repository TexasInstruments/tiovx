 * \details The capture node takes in a user data object of type <tt>\ref tivx_capture_params_t</tt> to
            configure one or more capture channels. The output is of type \ref vx_object_array, which contain an array of
            either \ref vx_image or \ref tivx_raw_image data types.  \ref vx_image is used if the sensor outputs processed
            image formats, while \ref tivx_raw_image is used for raw sensor outputs.

            If using \ref tivx_raw_image as the output, the raw image type MUST be one of the following formats:
            - Raw8  (\ref tivx_raw_image_create_params_t parameters msb = 7 and pixel_container = \ref TIVX_RAW_IMAGE_8_BIT)
            - Raw10 (\ref tivx_raw_image_create_params_t parameters msb = 9 and pixel_container = \ref TIVX_RAW_IMAGE_16_BIT)
            - Raw12 with either:
                - \ref tivx_raw_image_create_params_t parameters msb = 11 and pixel_container = \ref TIVX_RAW_IMAGE_16_BIT
                - \ref tivx_raw_image_create_params_t parameters msb = 11 and pixel_container = \ref TIVX_RAW_IMAGE_P12_BIT
            - Raw14 (\ref tivx_raw_image_create_params_t parameters msb = 13 and pixel_container = \ref TIVX_RAW_IMAGE_16_BIT)

            If using \ref vx_image, the image type MUST be one of the following formats:
            - \ref VX_DF_IMAGE_UYVY
            - \ref VX_DF_IMAGE_YUYV
            - \ref VX_DF_IMAGE_U16
            - \ref VX_DF_IMAGE_RGBX
            - \ref TIVX_DF_IMAGE_BGRX

            The number of items in the output object array corresponds to the number of syncronized, homogeneous
            camera sensors assigned to the capture node.  Each item in an object array must have the same
            dimensions and formats.  If multiple sensors are needed tot be configured at different rates, formats, or
            resolutions,  then separate capture nodes should be used and syncronized by the application code.

            \note The capture node does not program or control the sensors, but relies on the application (or custom nodes)
            to call into the sensor drivers.
