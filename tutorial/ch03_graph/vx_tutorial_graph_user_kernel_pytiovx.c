/**
 * \file vx_tutorial_graph_user_kernel_pytiovx.c Show example usage of using user kernel in larger graph.
 *
 * In the tutorial we learn below concepts,
 * - Use the user/target kernel defined in tutorial \ref vx_tutorial_graph_user_kernel.c
 *   in a larger graph
 * - Specify the user defined kernel in .py file in using PyTIOVX APIs
 * - Generate the graph code using the user defined kernel and other built-in kernels using the PyTIOVX APIs.
 *
 * When using PyTIOVX tool, first create a .py file which describes the OpenVX graph.
 * Follow comments in \ref vx_tutorial_graph_user_kernel_pytiovx_uc.py to understand
 * the graph description basic API. In this example, we also use the PyTIOVX API to define
 * a user defined kernel. This allows user to add their own kernels to the tool without
 * having to modify deep within the tool.
 *
 * Next PyTIOVX tool is run to generate .c/.h file for the graph described in .py file.
 * A .jpg file which shows the graph visually is also generated in the process.
 *
 * Follow steps mentioned in PyTIOVX user guide <a href="../pytiovx_guide/index.html" target="_blank">[HTML]</a>
 * to install and run the PyTIOVX tool. See also additional APIs provided to describe a
 * graph via PyTIOVX.
 *
 * For this example, run below command to generate the code and image file
 * \code
 * python vx_tutorial_graph_user_kernel_pytiovx_uc.py
 * \endcode
 *
 * Include the generated C code API header file
 * \code
 * #include <ch03_graph/vx_tutorial_graph_user_kernel_pytiovx_uc.h>
 * \endcode
 * Note, that the generated file name and APIs use as prefix the string name passed
 * as input during context create in the .py file.
 *
 * Follow the comments in the function vx_tutorial_graph_user_kernel_pytiovx()
 * to complete the rest of tutorial code to invoke the generated OpenVX graph.
 *
 *   <b> NOTE: </b> \n
 *   The implementation on HOST side for user kernel and target kernel is largely the same. Any
 *   difference in implementation between user kernel and target kernel is shown by using
 *   using boolen variable 'add_as_target_kernel'.
 *   - When 'add_as_target_kernel' is 'vx_false_e', it is the
 *   implementation for user kernel.
 *   - When 'add_as_target_kernel' is 'vx_true_e', it is the implementation
 *   for target kernel.
 *
 * Include below file to use the HOST callable interface for the user/target kernel
 * \code
 * #include <ch03_graph/phase_rgb_user_kernel.h>
 * \endcode
