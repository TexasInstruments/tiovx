/**
 * \file vx_tutorial_image_query.c Query image for attributes such as width, height and format
 *
 * In this tutorial we learn the below concepts,
 *
 * - How to create OpenVX context and OpenVX image data object
 * - How to read a BMP file and load the pixel values into the image data object
 * - How to query the image data object for attributes like width, height
 * - How to cleanup all created resources and exit the OpenVX application
 *
 * To include OpenVX interfaces include below file
 * \code
 * #include <VX/vx.h>
 * \endcode
 *
 * Follow the comments in the function vx_tutorial_image_query()
 * to understand this tutorial
 *
 * As part of this tutorial, we create few utility functions as listed below.
 * These functions will be used in subsequent tutorials to display node and graph attributes.
 *  <TABLE frame="box" rules="all" cellspacing="0" width="50%" border="1" cellpadding="3">
