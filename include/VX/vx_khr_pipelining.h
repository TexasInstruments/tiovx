/*! \brief Sets the graph scheduler config
 *
 * This API is used to set the graph scheduler config to
 * allow user to schedule multiple instances of a graph for execution.
 *
 * For legacy applications that don't need graph pipelining or batch processing,
 * this API need not be used.
 *
 * Using this API, the application specifies the graph schedule mode, as well as
 * queueing parameters for all graph parameters that need to allow enqueueing of references.
 * A single monolithic API is provided instead of discrete APIs, since this allows
 * the implementation to get all information related to scheduling in one shot and
 * then optimize the subsequent graph scheduling based on this information.
 * <b> This API MUST be called before graph verify </b> since
 * in this case it allows implementations the opportunity to optimize resources based on
 * information provided by the application.
 *
 * 'graph_schedule_mode' selects how input and output references are provided to a graph and
 * how the next graph schedule is triggered by an implementation.
 *
 * Below scheduling modes are supported:
 *
 * When graph schedule mode is <tt>\ref VX_GRAPH_SCHEDULE_MODE_QUEUE_AUTO</tt>:
 * - Application needs to explicitly call <tt>\ref vxVerifyGraph</tt> before enqueing data references
 * - Application should not call <tt>\ref vxScheduleGraph</tt> or <tt>\ref vxProcessGraph</tt>
 * - When enough references are enqueued at various graph parameters, the implementation
 *   could trigger the next graph schedule.
 * - Here, not all graph parameters need to have enqueued references for a graph schedule to begin.
 *   An implementation is expected to execute the graph as much as possible until a enqueued reference
 *   is not available at which time it will stall the graph until the reference becomes available.
 *   This allows application to schedule a graph even when all parameters references are
 *   not yet available, i.e do a 'late' enqueue. However, exact behaviour is implementation specific.
 *
 * When graph schedule mode is <tt>\ref VX_GRAPH_SCHEDULE_MODE_QUEUE_MANUAL</tt>:
 * - Application needs to explicitly call <tt>\ref vxScheduleGraph</tt>
 * - Application should not call <tt>\ref vxProcessGraph</tt>
 * - References for all graph parameters of the graph needs to enqueued before <tt>\ref vxScheduleGraph</tt>
 *   is called on the graph else an error is returned by <tt>\ref vxScheduleGraph</tt>
 * - Application can enqueue multiple references at the same graph parameter.
 *   When <tt>\ref vxScheduleGraph</tt> is called, all enqueued references get processed in a 'batch'.
 * - User can use <tt>\ref vxWaitGraph</tt> to wait for the previous <tt>\ref vxScheduleGraph</tt>
 *   to complete.
 *
 * When graph schedule mode is <tt>\ref VX_GRAPH_SCHEDULE_MODE_NORMAL</tt>:
 * - 'graph_parameters_list_size' MUST be 0 and
 * - 'graph_parameters_queue_params_list' MUST be NULL
 * - This mode is equivalent to non-queueing scheduling mode as defined by OpenVX v1.2 and earlier.
 *
 * By default all graphs are in VX_GRAPH_SCHEDULE_MODE_NORMAL mode until this API is called.
 *
 * 'graph_parameters_queue_params_list' allows to specify below information:
 * - For the graph parameter index that is specified, it enables queueing mode of operation
 * - Further it allows the application to specify the list of references that it could later
 *   enqueue at this graph parameter.
 *
 * For graph parameters listed in 'graph_parameters_queue_params_list',
 * application MUST use <tt>\ref vxGraphParameterEnqueueReadyRef</tt> to
 * set references at the graph parameter.  Using other data access API's on
 * these parameters or corresponding data objects will return an error.
 * For graph parameters not listed in 'graph_parameters_queue_params_list'
 * application MUST use the <tt>\ref vxSetGraphParameterByIndex</tt> to set the reference
 * at the graph parameter.  Using other data access API's on these parameters or
 * corresponding data objects will return an error.
 *
 * This API also allows application to provide a list of references which could be later
 * enqueued at the graph parameter. This allows implementation to do meta-data checking
 * up front rather than during each reference enqueue.
 *
 * The function vxSetGraphScheduleConfig should be called only before calling vxVerifyGraph, and the refs_list field should not be null. The implementation shall check for this.
 *
 * The schedule configuration must include all graph parameters even if the intention is not to queue some of them.
 * If any graph parameters had been added already when vxSetGraphScheduleConfig is called, they are removed and replaced with the new list.
 * Additionally, this function is responsible for adding parameters to the graph, identifying them using the first reference in the list of
 * references supplied for each graph parameter. The following rules apply to the list of references given:
 *    The first reference given in the list must be attached to at least one node parameter in the graph
 *    A reference may not appear as the first reference in more than one list
 *    The first reference in a list may not be NULL
 *    If a NULL reference is otherwise specified in the list, the results are implementation-dependent
 *    References in the list should be checked for compatibility so that the graphs are guaranteed to run (for example, all references may need to have the same metadata).
 *    Note that implementations may allow references of different types if connected nodes (and nodes subsequently connected to those nodes) allow a generic VX_TYPE_REFERENCE as the type.
 *    Where VX_BIDIRECTIONAL parameters are used, the direction of the graph parameter may not be the same as the direction of the parameter given on the last node to write data,
 *    due to the rules for execution precedence.
 *   The rules for direction reported in data obtained by vxGetGraphParameterConfig may differ and are given according to the connections of the reference in the following table:
 * | Reference connection                       | Direction of the graph parameter 
 * | VX_INPUT only                              | VX_INPUT
 * | VX_OUTPUT only                             | VX_OUTPUT
 * | VX_OUTPUT & VX_INPUT(s)                    | VX_OUTPUT
 * | VX_BIDIRECTIONAL only                      | VX_BIDIRECTIONAL
 * | VX_BIDIRECTIONAL & VX_INPUT(s)             | VX_BIDIRECTIONAL
 * | VX_BIDIRECTIONAL & VX_OUTPUT               | VX_OUTPUT
 * | VX_BIDIRECTIONAL, VX_OUTPUT & VX_INPUT(s)  | VX_OUTPUT
 *
 * Note
 *  A reference will not become ready for dequeuing until all nodes to which it is attached have executed, hence a VX_OUTPUT graph parameter 
 * will become available after the execution of any node to which it is connected as a VX_BIDIRECTIONAL or VX_INPUT parameter.
 *  The graph_parameter_index given in the array of structures must be unique and must be less than the number of graph parameters required.
