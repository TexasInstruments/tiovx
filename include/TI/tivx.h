 * The memory being imported to an OpenVX reference must adhere to the semantics of how the framework
 * allocates memory.  This is of particular note for a few OpenVX objects listed below.
 * 
 * - For \ref VX_TYPE_IMAGE references, multi-plane images shall be imported as a single entry.  The reason for
 *   this is that the framework allocates multi-plane images as a single contiguous memory buffer.  Therefore,
 *   if this is exported, it can also be freed as a single contiguous memory buffer rather than as separate
 *   buffers.
 * - For \ref VX_TYPE_PYRAMID objects, each pyramid level is allocated as a separate buffer and thus must be
 *   imported as a single entry per level.  Additionally, in the case that the pyramid levels are multi-plane
 *   images, these entries must be allocated as a single contiguous buffer with a size of all planes of the image.
 * - For \ref TIVX_TYPE_RAW_IMAGE objects with multiple exposures, these are allocated by the framework as separate
 *   buffers and thus must be imported as separate entries.
 *
 * Please note the important details below on semantics about the usage of the reference import and export.  Errors
 * will occur if the below requirements are not adhered to.
 *
 * - When calling the \ref tivxReferenceExportHandle API on a \ref vx_reference to obtain a handle and subsequently
 *   calling the \ref tivxReferenceImportHandle API to import the handle to a separate \ref vx_reference, the two
 *   references must be of the same type and have the same meta information.  This can be confirmed by using the
 *   \ref tivxIsReferenceMetaFormatEqual API.
 * - The handle exported by the \ref tivxReferenceExportHandle API will only be valid while the originally allocated
 *   handle is valid. For example, if a handle is exported from ref1 and imported into ref2, and then ref1 is released
 *   access to ref2 will result in attempting to access memory which has already been freed. It is therefore the
 *   responsibility of the application to ensure that the original memory allocation lifetime exceeds the lifetime of
 *   exported handle.
 * - In the example in the bullet above, in the case that ref1 must be released prior to ref2, the suggested approach
 *   is to import a NULL pointer to ref1, followed by a release of the reference.  At this point, ref2 has sole
 *   possession of the buffer while ref1 has no buffer dedicated to that reference.  An implementation of this approach
 *   can be found in the associated test cases located at tiovx/conformance_tests/test_tiovx/test_tivxMem.c.
 * - If memory has already been allocated to a \ref vx_reference and the \ref tivxReferenceImportHandle API is called
 *   on the \ref vx_reference, the previous buffer will be discarded and the \ref vx_reference will now use the
 *   imported buffer.  A log in the \ref VX_ZONE_INFO log level will be thrown on the console in this scenario to note
 *   that a buffer is being overridden.  Because this can be a dangerous situation, the \ref tivxReferenceExportHandle
 *   API shall be called on the \ref vx_reference in question.  The previous buffer can be used as required in the
 *   application before ultimately being freed by way of the \ref tivxMemFree API.
 * - The \ref tivxReferenceExportHandle API and \ref tivxReferenceImportHandle API must not be called if the reference
 *   has been enqueued to a \ref vx_graph.  This can cause a scenario where the graph overwrites the buffer contents
 *   and is thus is not in a state where it can be read by the application.
