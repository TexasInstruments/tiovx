 *          and existing log is cleared.
 *        - Calling this API periodically avoids the event log from getting full.
 *        - Thus this API allows to continously store data to a file on the filesystem, limited only by the
 *          size of free space on the filesystem.
 *        - The data stored in the file can be visualized by doing below
 *          - Copy the saved file(s) to PC
 *          - Convert the binary data to 'VCD - Value Change Dump' format
 *          - Use a opensource tool like gtkwave to visualize the data 
 *
